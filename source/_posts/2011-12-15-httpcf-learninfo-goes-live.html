<p>I'm happy to announce <a href="http://cf-learn.info/">http://cf-learn.info/</a>, the accompanying website for my book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022022.do">Learning CFEngine 3</a>, currently in Early Release from O'Reilly. </p>
<div>In this website you will find:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>General information about the book.</li>
<li>A discussion forum for any type of questions, feedback or suggestions about the book.</li>
<li>Downloadable code examples from the book, plus (over time) many other new examples.</li>
<li>List of Errata, and access to the Errata system at O'Reilly.</li>
<li>A blog devoted to the book and to CFEngine.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>The site is mostly empty at the moment (the blog, the forum and the errata page are live, I encourage you to participate, particularly if you have purchased the Early Release version of the book and want to provide any sort of feedback), but content will grow over time.</div>
<p></p>
<div>Thank you for visiting, and please let me know what you think!</div>
<p></p>
<div>Best regards,</div>
<div>--Diego</div>
