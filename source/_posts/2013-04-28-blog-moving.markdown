This blog had so far been hosted on posterous.com, but Posterous was
acquired last year by Twitter, and will be closing down on April
30th. I have now migrated the blog to Octopress hosted on GitHub, the
same as the rest of the [cf-learn.info](http://cf-learn.info/) site.

All the posts have been migrated, but there are still some rough
edges. Most notably, comments have not been migrated yet, and the
theme in the blog is different than the rest of the pages. Please bear
with me, and [let me know](http://cf-learn.info/contact.html) if you find anything else broken.

BTW, if you are subscribed to the blog through its feedburner.com
feed, you should not need to do anything to migrate (if you are seeing
this post, it means you are already seeing the new site). Otherwise,
please subscribe to the feedburner.com feed at
[http://feeds.feedburner.com/cf-learn](http://feeds.feedburner.com/cf-learn).

Thank you for reading! More frequent posts coming soon.
