A lot of people have asked me about the bird on the cover of the book, and I had to admit I didn't know. Unfortunately, the book (even in the print version) does not include a description of the cover in the Colophon, like most other O'Reilly books. But today I got the information directly from Karen Montgomery at O'Reilly, who designed the cover:<p></p>
<div>The bird is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tui_(bird)">Tui</a>, a kind of bird that leaves in New Zealand, also known as a Parson Bird. Here's a photo of a real Tui bird:</div>
