Some people have asked me what the status of the book is, so I thought I would post it here. The book is currently in the "production stage", which means that the draft has been finalized content-wise, and is now being prepared for publication by O'Reilly. They have a specialized group of people for this, who work on preparing nice final versions of the figures, making sure the layout of the book is correct, and doing a few thorough proofreading and editing passes. <p></p> This means that it's now really close to publication. I cannot make any promises about the specific date, but it should be before the end of March. <p></p> Thank you for your interest!
