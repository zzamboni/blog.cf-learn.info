A couple of days ago I finished writing all the material that was planned for the book, so it is now content-complete! I am now going through all the comments that came back from the tech reviewers, and from many readers that sent me feedback while reading the early release. After that it goes to the production department at O'Reilly for putting it in its final form, and then it will be ready for publication! <p></p> Thank you to everyone who has given me feedback and encouragement so far!
