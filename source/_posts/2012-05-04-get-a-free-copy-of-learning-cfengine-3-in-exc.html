<div>Are you a technical blogger? O'Reilly's "<a href="http://oreilly.com/bloggers/">Blogger Review Program</a>" allows bloggers to get free ebooks and videos, in exchange for writing reviews of them.</div>
<p></p>
<div>I'd love to see more reviews of "Learning CFEngine 3". If you have a technical blog, and would be interested in reviewing the book, I encourage you to visit <a href="http://oreilly.com/bloggers/">the program's website</a> to find out more.</div>

<div>Plus, I'm sure you will enjoy the book, and I would love to read your review!</div>
